// Classes are Blueprints for objects

// It has a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions)


//Atributes

// EG : If we want to create a class for triangle
// Attributes : base, height, hypotenuse // These are attributes or properties
// Each of data type has a data type associated with it and will act as variables.





//Behaviours
// Functions are called methods in OOP
// The behaviour is defined as the fucntions that are associated with the class
// EG : If we want to create a class for triangle
// Behaviours : calculateArea(), calculatePerimeter() // These are methods or functions
